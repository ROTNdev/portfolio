        <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>

        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Luke Anderson</strong>. I am 16 years old, currently in High School and planning to
            study Computer Science. I have a deep passion for all things Technology and gaming is a part of that. I am
            an
            enthusiastic, skilled team worker who can collaborate with anyone to build a fantastic final product.</p>
        <br>

        <h1><strong>Programming Background</strong></h1>
        <p>I have been an enthusiastic programmer and gamer for six years running (Since I was about ten). I have always been fascinated with Technology and all things related.</p>

        <p>For the past three or so years, I have focused heavily on PHP, and within the past fifteen months I have
            learned Java, and now focus on creating Minecraft Server Minigames/Plugins (with the Bukkit API).</p>

        <h1><strong>Skill Set</strong></h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux SSH Administration</li>
            <li>BungeeCord Setup/Interaction/Development</li>
            <li>Advanced Bukkit Plugin Development</li>
            <li>MySQL Integration (with Plugins)/Management</li>
            <li>Knowledge of git</li>
            <li>Maven knowledge</li>
            <li>Continuous integration (Jenkins) Setup/usage</li>
            <li>Apache server Management</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_reef');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_reef_button"></i> ReefMC <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reefmc.com" class="client_url">(Website)</a></h2>
        <div id="project_reef" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <p>Early March 2014, I was invited by a good friend of mine to work with ReefMC to help develop its
                multiserver network. My challenges were to help interconnect the network by building a core set of
                plugins with custom systems such as ban management solutions and network-wide player to player
                interactions (e.g. cross server private messaging and staff chat). Since these changes, the player
                response and active player base is better than it ever has been and continues to grow.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_ipnk');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_ipnk_button"></i> ImpulseNetwork</h2>
        <div id="project_ipnk" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <p>December 2013, I took upon the challenge of building a Network, from scratch. I was brought in as Developer, by two YouTuber’s (PixelSwift/SubZeroExtabyte - Two of the three founders). My goal/aim was to build a network, on a dedicated machine, that had Bungee integration and 4 unique game modes. This goal was achieved with a great level success.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_mctheship');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_mctheship_button"></i> MCTheShip</h2>
        <div id="project_mctheship" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <p>April 2013, when I wanted to develop a Minigame server, like Trouble in Mineville. I learnt of the game “The Ship” and wanted to recreate it in Minecraft. At this time, I was very ambitious and really didn’t know a lot about java.</p>
            <p>MCTheShip was open for 4 months, and did attract some attention. From the players that did play on the server, they really enjoyed it. I managed to create a complete working replica, however it is a shame I had to close down the server.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_prisonmc');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_prisonmc_button"></i> PrisonMC</h2>
        <div id="project_prisonmc" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <p>PrisonMC was a few months after MCTheShip. A friend of mine wanted to create a prison server, and he wanted my help. Simply, the task was to create a custom prison plugin, which controls everything (Mine Resets, Guard Features, and Ranking systems etc.). My friend didn’t want to use generic plugins, rather one plugin from me that game the same feel throughout the entire server. The server shut down a few months later due to lack of funds; however my Plugin was completed and fulfilled its duties.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_mcpluginsdev');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_mcpluginsdev_button"></i>
            MCPluginsDev <a target="_blank" href="http://mcpluginsdev.com" class="client_url">(Website)</a></h2>

        <div id="project_mcpluginsdev" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <p>MCPluginsDev is a new plugin development group, where paying clients can request a plugin and a developer can for-fill the job and create the plugin. We have around 15 clients per month and increasing.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h1><strong>Featured Clients</strong><span class="client_url"> (Click on <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> to expand)</span></h1>

        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_craftgasm');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_craftgasm_button"></i>
            CraftGasm <a target="_blank" href="http://craftgasm.net" class="client_url">(Website)</a></h2>

        <div id="project_craftgasm" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <h3><strong>DragonEntrance</strong></h3>

            <p>When a player joins the server for the first time, they get flown in to the spawn point by riding an
                EnderDragon. This looks quite spectacular and has never been done before. This plugin uses MySQL for
                support of multiple hubs (so you only can ride the dragon once), as well as custom mob
                creation/management.</p>

            <h3><strong>Warps</strong></h3>

            <p>Warps was a MySQL focused plugin which does as it's name suggests. It allowed the player to create up to
                9 warps, and less/more depending on their permissions. It had advanced full inventory
                controls/interactions which made it easy for players to use. The warp data was loaded/saved onto MySQL
                for ease of storage.</p>

            <h3><strong>CrystalFortune</strong></h3>

            <p>CraftGasm has a virtual economy called "Crystals". CrystalFortune allows the player to 'roll the dice'
                once every 24 hours, in the hope to win a bonus of Crystals every day. The player 'rolled the dice' by
                using an Inventory solution.</p>

            <h3><strong>InventoryStats</strong></h3>

            <p>CraftGasm has a fully functioning statistics API and system in place. InventoryStats uses that existing
                framework to get the player's statistics and display it in an inventory.</p>

        <div id="project_skyservers" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <h3><strong>FreezeTag</strong></h3>

            <p>FreezeTag is a simple replica of the childhood game of "Freeze" or "Stuck in the Mud". Essentially, the
                tagger has to tag all players to win. When a player is tagged, they cannot move. When they are not
                tagged, they can un-tag tagged players.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_strayyaprison');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_strayyaprison_button"></i> StrayyaPrison</h2>
        <div id="project_strayyaprison" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <p>StrayyaPrison were after a single plugin which controled every element of their prison server. StrayyaPrison's plugin was created and provided satisfaction for the clients who ran a successful and unique prison server. This was built before PrisonMC, and provided elements for PrisonMC's custom plugin.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_lavacraft');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_lavacraft_button"></i> LavaCraft <a target="_blank" href="http://mclava.com/" class="client_url">(Website)</a></h2>
        <div id="project_lavacraft" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <h3><strong>LavaTab</strong></h3>
            <p>A custom plugin that changes who is shown where on the TAB list, with full permission rank support.</p>
            <h3><strong>LavaVoteReminder</strong></h3>
            <p>Simple plugin, reminds users at a configurable time with a configurable message who haven’t voted within the past 24 hours.</p>
            <h3><strong>Capture The Flag</strong></h3>
            <p>Capture The Flag is a fast paced game mode where two teams have to battle it out to retrieve the other teams Flag, and take it to their base. This scores a point. You need three points to win.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_minevision');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_minevision_button"></i> MineVision <a target="_blank" href="http://minevision.us/" class="client_url">(Website)</a></h2>
        <div id="project_minevision" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <h3><strong>Sumotori</strong></h3>
            <p>Sumoroti is a replica of the Japanese sport Sumo. Essentially, player battle it out with a stick (with added knock back) and the last team standing, wins!</p>
        </div>
        <h2 onclick="toggle('project_legendaryprison');"><i class="fa fa-caret-right" id="project_legendaryprison_button"></i> LegendaryPrison</h2>
        <div id="project_legendaryprison" style="overflow: hidden; display: none;">
            <p>I was hired at LegendaryPrision for a short amount of time (I quit due to personal reasons that occurred). I did various tasks such as light plugin/web management, and as well as making sure the server was functioning properly.</p>
